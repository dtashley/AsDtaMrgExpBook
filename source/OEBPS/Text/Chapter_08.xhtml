<ul><li>rationally irrational<br/></li>
<li>from crazy idea to project in two days<br/></li>
<li>reality check: marriage greencard (I would include a discussion of how unusual the US approach is - most countries offer 2-3 year residence permits for the spouses of citizens which are a lot easier to get, but the US approach feels kind of more appropriate in some way; it take marriage more seriously, and in a way, accepts the foreign spouse into the family.
