   <b>Preface</b>
</h1>

<p>
   At the present time, the preface is a placeholder that contains
   content of three types:
</p>

<ul>
      <li>
         Notes from Dave to Anke about proposed changes to the
         book that are significant enough that further
         coordination is required.
      </li>
      <li>
         Notes from Anke to Dave, with significance as described
         in the point above.
      </li>
      <li>
         The preface, a work in progress.
      </li>
   </ul>

      Anke--please feel free to interject your thoughts into

      <i>Sigil</i> seems most comfortable moving unordered lists
      outside of paragraphs.  I've been putting them in paragraphs
      forever.  i have to trust <i>Sigil</i>'s judgment on this,
      as presumably it was written by folks who are far more
      familiar with HTML than me.

      Did you ever receive information
      from any of our attorneys about whether a will has
      be done <i>after</i> the execution of the prenup?
      I think the answer to this question may be important
      for readers.

      I had planned to do much more work on this today,
      but Bill called (11/25/2022, 3:20 p.m.), and I had
      forgotten we planned to go out to dinner today.
      Will resume soon.  I have more thoughts.
   </li>
   <li>
      At the time I'm leaving off, <i>Sigil</i> is warning
      about HTML it doesn't like.  Will fix.
   </li>
   <li>
      Several paragraphs above is an HTML comment.
      Hope you can see that, Anke.  I wonder if that is
      one of the things <i>Sigil</i> doesn't like.
