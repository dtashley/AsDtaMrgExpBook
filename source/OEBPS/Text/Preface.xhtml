   <b>Preface</b>
</h1>

<p>
   At the present time, the preface is a placeholder that contains
   content of three types:
</p>

<ul>
      <li>
         Notes from Dave to Anke about proposed changes to the
         book that are significant enough that further
         coordination is required.
      </li>
      <li>
         Notes from Anke to Dave, with significance as described
         in the point above.
      </li>
      <li>
         The preface, a work in progress.
      </li>
   </ul>

      Anke--please feel free to interject your thoughts into

      <i>Sigil</i> seems most comfortable moving unordered lists
      outside of paragraphs.  I've been putting them in paragraphs
      forever.  i have to trust <i>Sigil</i>'s judgment on this,
      as presumably it was written by folks who are far more
      familiar with HTML than me.
   </li>
   <li>
      Did you ever receive information
      from any of our attorneys about whether a will has
      be done <i>after</i> the execution of the prenup?
      I think the answer to this question may be important
      for readers.
   </li>
   <li>
      I had planned to do much more work on this today,
      but Bill called (11/25/2022, 3:20 p.m.), and I had
      forgotten we planned to go out to dinner today.
      Will resume soon.  I have more thoughts.
   </li>
   <li>
      At the time I'm leaving off, <i>Sigil</i> is warning
      about HTML it doesn't like.  Will fix.
   </li>
   <li>
      Several paragraphs above is an HTML comment.
      Hope you can see that, Anke.  I wonder if that is
      one of the things <i>Sigil</i> doesn't like.
   </li>
   <li>
      Do we have any thoughts on the title of the book?
      We now have four attorneys involved (with the
      addition of Mr. Gaetz to help with probate 
      and wills).  Should it be <i>Four Attorneys and
      a Wedding</i>?  Or do we want to go in a different
      direction?
   </li>
   <li>
      Where will we discuss the prenup experience in detail?
      That depends on what you have planned for Chapter
      9.
   </li>
   <li>
      I would also like to talk about experiences in selecting
      and interacting with immigration attorneys and
      estate/probate/will attorneys.  There may be some
      detailed stories and thoughts.  Where is your plan
      for where this goes?
   </li>
   <li>
      I had planned to use real attorney names, but not
      include any direct negative information about them.
      That begs another question&mdash;do we want to invite
      the attorneys to write sections of the book?  I'm sure
      that the immigration attorney, for example, would have
      a lot to say about why one wants an attorney.
   </li>
   <li>
      What is the accepted current etiquette for whether
      the woman's or the man's name goes first when both
      are mentioned?  I'm used to mentioning the woman first,
      but most legal things I've seen seem to mention the
      man's name first.  Thoughts?
   </li>
