Chapter 2: Oktoberfest (This is Where It Starts)
</b>
</h1>

<p>
Random thoughts for this chapter:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>what is Oktoberfest? (a paragraph about the history, another about what it's about - lots of beer, loud music and too many people essentially - and why it is rather absurd that this is where the two of us would have met up first after so many years)<br/></li>
<li>what came before (the occasional messenger update - once in two years or so - , me being single and kiddo off to college...) - this can also go at the end of the prologue<br/></li>
<li>Excel itinerary - "it's not the detail - it's the time frame!"</li>
<li>I'm introducing Dave to Whatsapp (Americans clinging to SMS...)</li>
</ul>
