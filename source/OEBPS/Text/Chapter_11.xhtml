<h2>Ordering and Waiting for the Certified Marriage Certificate</h2>
<h3>Bride's Remarks (Anke)</h3>
<p>TBD.</p>
<h3>Groom's Remarks (Dave)</h3>
<p>Marriage was in the Clark County database about a week after the marriage.</p>
<p>Ordered certified marriage certificates.</p>
<p>Received e-mail within a couple days indicating order would be mailed USPS within a couple days, but to contact the Clark County office only after 3 weeks had elapsed with no receipt.Â  Suspect they will come sooner.</p>
